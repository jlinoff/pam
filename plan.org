* Thoughts
  1. Keep things simple, add complexity over time by making small changes
  2. Use bootstrap to simplify layout and popups
  3. Fully dynamic, no static HTML in index.html
  4. No dark mode to start with.
  5. Start with simple menu:
     1. About, Preferences, Help, New Record, Open File, Save File
     2. Don't need Helpin the first iteration.
  6. Simple Initial preferences
     1. password minimum length
     2. password maximum length
     3. cryptic password special characters
  7. DONE: Start with a single input type (text)
     1. Incrementally add text area, number, url, date, etc.
     2. Add password last (it is the hardest)
  8. Incorporate "Duplicate" logic later to save typing.
  9. Store "About" and "Help" text in separate HTML?
     1. Does that make sense? Is it possible.
  10. Add open all tabs/close all accordion entries functionality.
  11. Add separate copy to clipboard button to allow natural use of URL fields.
  12. Add show/hide for passwords.
  13. Get basic flow working:
      1. create new record
      2. display record
      3. edit record
  14. Install pylenium to test and to add multiple records.
  15. Don't store data in javascript internally use the DOM.
  16. Learn about new field names over time from user input.

* Bugs
** DONE textarea has <pre></pre> after load (on save?) (see example4.txt)
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 10:38]
** DONE password overwritten with asterisks "*********" on save
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 10:24] worked correctly with example5 not
   sure how to reproduce it.
** DONE password overwritten with asterisks "*********" on edit
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 10:38] is this occurring in
   CopyRecordFieldsToEditDlg?
** DONE password generation does not work for loaded files
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 10:38] this was the same bug as the
   "**********" on edit bug
** DONE on load, password field shows up in name field for example5
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 08:07] seems to only happen intermittently,
   perhaps the first time?  found it hard to reproduce This has ben
   fixed for some time.
** DONE add search support
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 11:01] This turned out to be trivially easy
   because of ~d-none~.  Created filterRecords().
** DONE remove filename prompt from load
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 10:41]
** DONE implement xGetParentWithClass
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 12:44] This is a useful refactor that make
   the system more resilient
** DONE fix ~undefined~ value for new fields
   CLOSED: [2022-04-17 Sun 12:45]
** DONE implement prefs dialogue
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 08:06] Actually did this yesterday.  It
   only supports min/max password length at the moment.
** DONE fix text/password value display in edit mode - needs to expand
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 09:40] Made it adaptive.
** DONE fix fonts
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 09:40] Fixed some time ago.
** DONE remove console.log debug messages
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mon 20:56] Removed most of them.
** DONE Delete operation for new new record fields does not delete the field name.
   CLOSED: [2022-04-26 Tue 08:39] Steps to reproduce:
   1. Select "New Record"
   2. Select "Add text field"
   3. Click "Delete"
   4. The "Field Name" will remain.
   The problem was that there are now multiple rows to allow
   name/value on the same line.  The solution was to find the
   associated form (x-fld-form) and delete its contents.  Added test
   in test/test_mystuff:test_new_record().
** DONE URL getting corrupted by linkable anchor tag
   CLOSED: [2022-04-29 Fri 08:32]
   1. Select "New Record"
   2. Select "Add url field"
   3. Enter valid URL "https://google.com"
   4. Click "Save" to save the record.
   5. Select "Save File" from the menu.
   6. The error message will appear.
   Fixed as part of the logic clean up in utils.js:mkRecordField()
** DONE textarea losing newline formatting
   CLOSED: [2022-04-29 Fri 08:33] Fixed as part of the logic clean up
   in utils.js:mkRecordField()
** DONE all accordion items should be closed on load
   CLOSED: [2022-04-29 Fri 09:26] newly created accordion items were
   modified to always display as closed.
** DONE Only dragging vertically (gave up)
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 09:43] I am not sure this is possible.
   It's not possible for the built-in draggable but it can be
   accomplished manually but it is too much work for now.
** DONE Cannot delete the "security question" from ~/tmp/bug01.txt~
   CLOSED: [2022-04-29 Fri 10:05] Steps to recreate:
   1. load /tmp/bug01.txt
   2. edit "Google"
   3. click "Delete" to delete the "security question" field.
   4. click "Save" to save the record.
   make sure to delete the whole field by deleting the row
   ~x-new-rec-fld~.  not deleting it left artifacts which created an
   unstable state.
** DONE Fix overflow in text and password fields for small screens.
   CLOSED: <2022-04-29 Fri 10:05> Added ~overflow-auto~ class
** DONE Fix draggable conflict between row field and password length and text select
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 09:38] Steps to recreate:
   1. select "New Record"
   2. select "password"
   3. select "Generate" (the gear)
   4. try to slide the range length indicator slider.
   Could this be fixed by setting ~draggable=false~ on the range
   slider?  NO, that did not work.  Another option might be to try
   just making the legend draggable (that is a lot of refactoring).
   Yet another option is to make the top level draggable false while
   in the password generation dialogue. I tested this manually and it
   works!  Yet another way is to remove draggable onfocus and add it
   back onblur. This could work for all inputs. This was the solution
   i chose.
** DONE Update test to look up field types by name in record create/edit
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 08:19] Just loop through the
   ~.dropdown-item~ elements and look at the value.
** DONE Change top menu text "menu" to icon.
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 08:40] Decided to use the ~bi-list~ icon
   but there were other reasonable candidates as well like
   ~bi-menu-down~.
** DONE Add delete and show/hide to "Load File" and "Save File" dialogues password entry.
CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 18:21] Reuse the edit stuff if possible.  had
to duplicate code! SIGH!
** DONE DRY duplicated code from adding clear, show/hide to Load and Save.
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 18:30] created
   utils.js:mkLoadSavePassword().
** DONE Add clearBeforeLoad and loadDupStrategy to prefs dialogue
   CLOSED: [2022-05-01 Sun 08:27]
** DONE Remove alert from "Dup" logic.
   CLOSED: [2022-05-01 Sun 07:37]
** DONE Add missing generate (gear) to the "Save File" password dialogue
   CLOSED: [2022-05-01 Sun 16:05] Reuse the edit stuff if possible.
   This is not needed for the "Load File" dialogue.
** DONE Add word separator to prefs for memorable password generation
   CLOSED: [2022-04-30 Sat 12:39] This requires updating
   ~windows.prefs~, the prefs dialogue and the memorable password
   generation.  Added support for
   1. memorablePasswordWordSeparator
   2. memorablePasswordMinWordLength
   3. memorablePasswordMinWords
   4. memorablePasswordMaxWords
   5. memorablePasswordMaxTries
** DONE Implement encryption using subtle crypto
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mon 16:15] documentation
   [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto][link]]
   The app has to be resilient.  If it is not run a in a secure
   context it should still work but encryption/decryption is not
   available.  This was tricky, see ~crypt.js~ for details.
** DONE Fix mobile display of "Delete" "Dup" "Edit" buttons for each record.
   CLOSED: [2022-05-01 Sun 10:21]
** DONE Improve statusBlip messages on mobile
   CLOSED: [2022-05-01 Sun 10:46] They look too much like an info
   button.  Fixed by changing to exclamation-octagon.
** DONE Added clear option to search bar (x) for all browsers
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mon 17:10] Is there a way to turn it off in
   Chrome?
** DONE Generate password on iphone causes a failure
   CLOSED: [2022-05-01 Sun 13:40] Steps to reproduce
   1. load ~example1.txt~
   2. select 'Amazon'
   3. select 'Edit'
   4. select gear (generate)
   5. click on 'close password generator'
   6. weep
   Not reproducible!
** DONE Load not setting windows.prefs fields.
   CLOSED: [2022-05-01 Sun 15:04]
** DONE Change app name to PAM - Personal Accounts Manager
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mon 08:49] It's better than JERK - Joe's
   Electronic Record Keeper :-)
** DONE Load twice creates a second menu!
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mon 10:18] This is critical and it is a pain.
   The bug was that it was creating the wrong DOM elements: mkMenu()
   instead of mkMenuPrefsDlg()
** DONE Back out the dark theme
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mon 20:55] It did not work well, some hover
   responses did not work properly
** DONE Recfactor ~utils.js~ into ~records.js~, ~field.js~ and ~utils.js~
   CLOSED: [2022-05-14 Sat 18:25] This is just general hygiene.
** DONE Add retry logic for invalid password during load
   CLOSED: [2022-05-03 Tue 08:08] Do not leave the load dialogue when
   an invalid password is specified on Save.  The user can always exit
   the dialogue by clicking on Close.
** DONE Allow the user to define the field type names in preferences
   CLOSED: [2022-05-14 Sat 18:24] Each field type name is tuple of the
   name and the input type.  Examples: [ ~account~, ~text~ ], [
   ~name~, ~text~ ] Primitive implementation complete.  Enhancements
   will be capture in separate issues.
** DONE Modify to support path: ~/pam/www/js/main.js~ to make it easier to release
   CLOSED: [2022-05-14 Sat 11:43] This will make it easier to release
   to https://jlinoff.github.io.  It will require changes to ~make
   run~.  Made all of the paths relative to keep things simple.
** DONE Change test program name to ~tests/test_pam.py~
   CLOSED: [2022-05-14 Sat 18:24]
** DONE Move add field to top of list in prefs
   CLOSED: [2022-05-14 Sat 21:33]
** DONE Add text to the add field button to make its function clearer
   CLOSED: [2022-05-14 Sat 21:34]
** CANCELLED Fix copy to clipboard bug on iphone and ipad
   CLOSED: [2022-05-15 Sun 09:01] The problem is that the HTTP server
   is not secure so navigator.clipboard is not defined.  This fix is
   to have a HTTPS server.
** DONE Use drop down menus for field types in the prefs dialog
   CLOSED: [2022-05-18 Wed 17:47] instead of forcing them to type it
   in
** CANCELLED Allow the user to define a custom title in preferences
   CLOSED: [2022-05-18 Wed 17:52] No need for this because the title
   is never displayed.
** DONE Allow the user to add a short custom about description in the preferences
   CLOSED: [2022-05-18 Wed 18:37]
** DONE Modify loads/save logic to use ~Object.entries()~ iterator.
   CLOSED: [2022-05-18 Wed 18:38]
** DONE Add Help menu item
   CLOSED: [2022-05-19 Thu 21:39]
** DONE Change Dup to Clone
   CLOSED: [2022-05-19 Thu 21:49]
** DONE Password length not displayed properly in edit dialogue on load
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 11:47]
** DONE Add fieldsets to prefs dialogue
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 11:47]
** DONE initialize all preferences on load to make sure all prefs are present
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 11:53] This will make sure that any
   preferences that were added since the file was saved are present
   with default settings).
** DONE Add preference: "cloneFieldValues"
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 12:36] Not sure if this is really useful
   yet???  Added it anyway to test it out.
** DONE Add preference: "memorablePasswordPrefix"
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 13:27]
** DONE Add preference: "memorablePasswordSuffix"
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 13:27]
** DONE Add preference: "helpLink"
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 13:27]
** DONE Add preference: "projectLink"
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 13:27]
** DONE Fix links on About page
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 13:29] They currently point to myvault :-)
   Updated to link based on variable.
** CANCELLED Password generator fails on the very first update in when creating a new field.
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 13:31] Steps to reproduce.
   1. new record
   2. new password field
   3. click the generate button
   4. record disappears - identical steps work the next time (in the same session
   Could not reproduce it.
** DONE Add Help infrastructure somewhere
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 14:18] Use the ~pandoc~ markdown to HTML
   approach used by myvault Make sure to mention the secure HTTP
   context.  Maybe at the end of the menu? YES create ~HELP.md~.
** DONE Add some sort of infrastructure for a versioning system
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 14:18] Could be VERSION file that is used
   to create/update ~www/js/version.js~.  Could be something else.
** DONE ignore generated and downloaded files
   CLOSED: [2022-05-20 Fri 14:23] Added ~.gitignore~
** DONE Verify that relative paths work for https://jlinoff.github.io/
   CLOSED: [2022-05-21 Sat 07:42] Steps:
   1. clone jlinoff.github.io
   2. mkdir jlinoff.github.io/pam
   3. cp -r $HOME/web/pam/www jlinoff.github.io/pam
   4. rm -rf jlinoff.github.io/pam/www.venv
   5. git add $(find -type f pam)
   6. git commit -am'add pam for testing'
   7. navigate to https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html
   Relative paths works like a charm.
** DONE Add support for the ~.pam~ file extension
   CLOSED: [2022-05-21 Sat 07:49] Continue to support ~.txt~ and
   ~.js~.
** DONE Fix record button layout for small screens
   CLOSED: [2022-05-21 Sat 08:01]
   The "Edit" button drops down below the "Delete" button.
   Made the button font smaller.
** DONE clipboard copy not showing number of bytes copied on status line
   CLOSED: [2022-05-22 Sun 19:14]
   to reproduce:
   1. load file
   2. select record
   3. copy any field value to the clipboard
   statusBlip was not implemented.
** DONE Show the total number of records
   CLOSED: [2022-05-23 Mon 13:41]
   The total number of shown records is next to the search bar x at
   the top.
** CANCELLED Add support for lock (read-only) mode
   CLOSED: [2022-05-24 Tue 15:35]
   This would lock the app so that changes could not be made to preferences or records.
   Lock mode would do the following:
   1. Disable or hide "Preferences" on the menu.
   2. Disable or hide "Save File" on the menu.
   3. Disable or hide the "Delete", "Clone" and "Edit" buttons on each record.
   The idea is to allow pam to be used by folks who only care about the account
   data but that do not want to modify it.
   Lock mode should require a password.
   Not needed.
** DONE Add search preferences
   CLOSED: [2022-05-24 Tue 10:40]
   Add four search preferences:
   1. searchCaseInsensitive
   2. searchRecordTitles
   3. searchRecordFieldNames
   4. searchRecordFieldValues
   The goal is to allow me to find all records that use obsolete emails or passwords

   Some ideas:
   1. Make sure that password fields span at least as far as the field names.
      1. For editing this can be done by moving the extra buttons (generate, etc.)
         to the bottom of the field edit dialogue [DONE].
      2. For presentation, stack the buttons vertically.
   2. Consider stacking field names and values to make more horizontal room [DONE].
   3. Consider making some of the fonts smaller to allow more records per window [DONE].
** DONE Add last commit id and date to about page.

** DONE Password generator fails on the very first update in when generating a password.

   1. start new browser window
   2. new record
   3. new password field
   4. click the generate button
   5. record disappears
   I have reported this, at least twice before but had trouble reproducing it!
   It is a very frustrating bug!
   Finally figured out that the bug is caused by closing the child dialogue.
   This is probably a bootstrap bug.
   Fortunately it works after the first failure.
   The best way to fix it may be to simply mock the initial creation
   or limit event propagation.
   The fix turned out to be add event.preventDefault()
** DONE Change ~HELP.md~ to ~README.md~

** TODO Save file does not allow user to select the directory (or file name)
   Steps to reproduce.
   1. load ~example1.txt~
   2. save
** TODO Add test for save operation
   This is tricky because i don't know how to specify directories to the system file dialog
   in pylenium.

* Problems of the day

** how do i set the background color for the body of the app?
   Ans. Figured out how to do it in bootstrap (see bs0).
   1. set background color of everything>?
   2. set the background color for just the container?
   3. Maybe bootstrap is NOT the right way to go for this?
